              you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long

              not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser
              settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs,
              which is code that sends information about your use to a server
              and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us

              when you submit a job application and supporting materials. Where
              you submit a job application on behalf of another person, you
              confirm that you have made that person aware of how we collect,
              use and share their Personal Data, the reason you have provided
              it, how they can contact us, the terms of this Privacy Notice and
              related policies and that they have consented to such collection,
              use and sharing. You can also choose to submit, or we may collect
              additional information about yourself, such as demographic
              information (for example your gender, birth date, or zip code) and
              information about your preferences and interests. Failure to
              provide any required Personal Data will prevent us from being able
              to provide the Services you request (e.g., member registration or
              submission of job application) or otherwise inhibit our ability to
              provide the Services.
